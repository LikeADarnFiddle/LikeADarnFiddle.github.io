Hi there!  I'm Fiddl3.  Recent IT & Cybersec grad working on a portfolio site to get back into the swing of things post-grad, on topics and projects I actually want to do & care about rather than things I'm required to do. <br/>

Possible inclusions: <br/>
-Art section <br/>
  -Beginner - seriously probably won't do this until I feel comfortable actually posting my work in places.  Probably pony-related. <br/>
-Previous projects <br/>
  -Kinda the point of a portfolio.  We're well past the era of "just making a portfolio website is enough to land you a position", so I'll try to keep it *fancy* <br/>
-Blog <br/>
  -Maybe not.  Not sure yet - I don't like the thought of being "that guy who posts into the void to no-one and nothing" <br/>

TODO: <br/>
-Finish homepage skeleton in HTML <br/>
  -Navbar <br/>
  -Images <br/>
  -Split it up nice <br/>
-Fancify some parts with CSS <br/>
  -Fonts <br/>
  -Keep the image still as you scroll, always loved that <br/>
  -Subtle off-white coloring <br/>
-Implement JS & JS Frameworks <br/>
  -Buttons! Drop-down nav bars! React! The things employers want, I guess. <br/>
-Rework old projects to look nice <br/>
  -Seriously man, you gotta work on that.  Your baseline was made almost a decade ago, get with the times. <br/>
-Get hired? <br/>
  -Unlikely.  Good luck. <br/>
