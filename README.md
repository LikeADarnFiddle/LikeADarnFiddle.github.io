  Hi there!  I'm Fiddl3.  Recent IT & Cybersec grad working on a portfolio site to get back into the swing of things post-grad, on topics and projects I actually want to do & care about rather than things I'm required to do.

Possible inclusions:
-Art section
  -Beginner - seriously probably won't do this until I feel comfortable actually posting my work in places.  Probably pony-related.
-Previous projects
  -Kinda the point of a portfolio.  We're well past the era of "just making a portfolio website is enough to land you a position", so I'll try to keep it *fancy*
-Blog
  -Maybe not.  Not sure yet - I don't like the thought of being "that guy who posts into the void to no-one and nothing"

TODO:
-Finish homepage skeleton in HTML
  -Navbar
  -Images
  -Split it up nice
-Fancify some parts with CSS
  -Fonts
  -Keep the image still as you scroll, always loved that
  -Subtle off-white coloring [Pseudo-done because I'm impatient]
-Implement JS & JS Frameworks
  -Buttons! Drop-down nav bars! React! The things employers want, I guess.
-Rework old projects to look nice
  -Seriously man, you gotta work on that.  Your baseline was made almost a decade ago, get with the times.
-Get hired?
  -Unlikely.  Good luck.
